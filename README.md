Vilify
======

You are a mad scientist, who has just completed a doomsday device! In 24 hours the device will erupt, destroying the world! Unfortunately, those pesky Super Heroes have discovered your evil plan, and now they are invading your lab! (Why can't they just mind their own business for once! All you are trying to do is only destroying the world!) Now you must build electronic defense towers, mix poisonous potions, and raise the dead! Protect your lab!
